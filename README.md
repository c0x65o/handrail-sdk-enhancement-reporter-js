# @handrail/enhancement-reporter

Authenticated, web-only customer enhancement requests for Handrail. The package provides a browser client, a ready-to-use React dialog, and a framework-neutral same-origin server handler with its own narrow Handrail REST transport. It does not require `@handrail/mcp`.

Every submission creates a first-class Project Management Enhancement and starts a read-only AI assessment when that runtime option is enabled. Assessment can gather repository evidence, propose acceptance criteria and QA, and assess source-change risk, but it cannot edit source, commit, implement, or deploy. After a current assessment reaches Proposal Ready, Handrail revalidates the current Known User role and project policy. Work within that role's automatic implementation risk ceiling creates a linked implementation Work Request; work outside the ceiling remains available to staff through Handrail's audited manual authorization action. Every request stays scoped to the authenticated Known User who submitted it.

## Install

Install the latest available reporter directly from its canonical GitHub
repository; the package should not be assumed to exist in the npm registry:

```sh
npm install \
  '@handrail/enhancement-reporter@github:c0x65o/handrail-sdk-enhancement-reporter-js'
```

You do not need a Handrail Maintenance commit hash, tag, or dependency pin
before implementing. Commit the application manifest and refreshed lockfile
together. The lockfile records the resolved revisions so Owner Maintenance can
report version and commit drift later.

Use these Git dependencies directly. Do not vendor reporter tarballs, copied
package directories, or local file dependencies. Maintenance compares the
resolved Git commit with this repository and can move every installed project
to the same current revision through its controlled update plan.

The enhancement reporter has a dedicated first-class Enhancement Reporting API and capability; `@handrail/mcp` is not an application integration dependency. The browser entry never accepts or transmits a Handrail transport credential. Mount the server handler on the same origin, behind your normal application authentication boundary, and keep the transport credential in server-only environment variables.

Handrail provisions the `enhancement_reporting` capability against one exact server runtime and injects only the enhancement-specific variables below. It is independent from assistant features and credentials.

```text
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_ENABLED
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_API_URL
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_VERSION
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_PROJECT_ID
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_CAPABILITY_ID
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_SERVICE_ENV_ID
HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_TOKEN
```

Treat `HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_ENABLED=true` as the only server-runtime
availability signal for this reporter. Do not substitute a generic assistant
capability flag or an app-owned enhancement mode. Fail closed when the value is
not exactly `true` or when the enabled runtime is missing any of the injected
values. `HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_SERVICE_ENV_ID` is server-only binding
metadata for exact-runtime readiness checks; it is not a browser or submission
field.

## Server route

The example below fits a Next.js catch-all route at `app/api/handrail-enhancements/[[...path]]/route.ts`. The same handler works with any framework that supplies Web `Request` and `Response` objects.

```ts
import { createSameOriginEnhancementReporterHandler } from "@handrail/enhancement-reporter/server";

const handler = createSameOriginEnhancementReporterHandler({
  enabled: process.env.HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_ENABLED === "true",
  routeBasePath: "/api/handrail-enhancements",
  apiUrl: process.env.HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_API_URL!,
  projectId: process.env.HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_PROJECT_ID!,
  capabilityId: process.env.HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_CAPABILITY_ID!,
  token: process.env.HANDRAIL_ENHANCEMENT_REPORTER_TOKEN!,
  contractVersion: "v1",
  async resolveApplicationSessionToken(request) {
    // Read and validate your authenticated HttpOnly app session here.
    // Return its opaque raw token. Handrail hashes and verifies it against the
    // Known Users session source configured for this exact environment.
    return readAuthenticatedSessionToken(request);
  },
});

export const GET = handler;
export const POST = handler;
```

The handler rejects missing Known User sessions and cross-site requests. It forwards neither cookies nor application authorization headers. Keep the route behind your framework's normal CSRF/session protections as well.

Runtime enablement and principal discovery are separate checks, not access
modes. The server flag above controls whether the same-origin adapter exists.
After authentication, `enhancement_reporting.enabled` confirms that the
first-class reporter is available, and
`enhancement_reporting.history.enabled` is the canonical **My requests**
capability. `enhancement_reporting.user_enabled` is retained only for older
server compatibility; application code must not require it for submission or
history. The packaged UI prefers `history.enabled` and consults
`user_enabled` only when an older discovery response omits the history
capability. Known User roles affect later automation policy, not intake or
owned-history eligibility.

Trusted server integrations such as the Handrail MCP connector may use
`createRequestScopedEnhancementReporter` from the server entry point instead of
mounting a browser route. Its resolver is called for every request context and
must return the current opaque application session. The factory fails closed
when no session is available and never accepts a caller-selected user ID.
This optional composition still uses the dedicated enhancement reporter runtime
tuple directly; it does not route through Assistant Change Bridge or make an
MCP package part of the reporter contract.

## Choose an integration path

The SDK has two independent adoption paths:

- **Packaged React UI:** mount `EnhancementReporterButton` or control
  `EnhancementReporterDialog` yourself for a complete submission and owned
  history experience.
- **Custom/headless UI:** call the browser client directly, or use the React
  provider and `useEnhancementReporter()` hook with your own components.

The packaged UI is strictly opt-in. Importing this package, mounting only the
provider, or upgrading an existing integration never inserts a launcher or
opens a dialog. Bugs remain a separate SDK, API, and presentation surface.

## Packaged React UI

```tsx
import {
  EnhancementReporterButton,
  EnhancementReporterProvider,
} from "@handrail/enhancement-reporter/react";

export function AccountMenu() {
  return (
    <EnhancementReporterProvider
      config={{
        endpoint: "/api/handrail-enhancements",
        appVersion: import.meta.env.VITE_APP_VERSION,
      }}
    >
      <EnhancementReporterButton
        label="Suggest an enhancement"
        appearance={{ themeMode: "auto" }}
      />
    </EnhancementReporterProvider>
  );
}
```

`EnhancementReporterButton` is the launcher; `EnhancementReporterDialog` is
also exported separately for an app-owned launcher or menu. Both delegate
discovery, submission, subscriptions, and history mutations to the same client
provided by `EnhancementReporterProvider` (or to an explicit `client` prop).
Equivalent inline configuration objects do not recreate that client on every
parent render; changing an actual configuration field still creates the new
reporter instance.
The compact, wide desktop dialog mirrors Handrail's packaged bug reporter. The
request form and history share one bounded height so the shell stays stable as
users switch views. A header-level **My requests** button opens request history,
and **New request** returns to the form. On desktop the outcome field and image
area expand to use
the remaining form height instead of leaving an empty lower region, while the
priority selector sits beside an **Attached context** panel,
with notifications grouped into the same side
rail. The context panel shows the current route, page title, application
version, and viewport values that the client will submit; no build field is
shown in the packaged form.
When discovery supplies a verified Known User role, the side rail also shows a
compact **Your access** summary. It names the effective Requester, Contributor,
or Maintainer role, the maximum automatic implementation risk, and the
production threshold for the currently selected priority. This is personal,
read-only context rather than the full project policy; changing Priority updates
the summary, while final deployment remains subject to the separate project
deployment policy.
After Handrail accepts a request, the form is replaced by a dedicated thank-you
screen rather than leaving submitted fields editable. It confirms whether
email updates were enabled, keeps notification failure separate from request
success, and offers **Submit another enhancement** and **Done** actions.

### Appearance and accessibility

`appearance.themeMode` accepts `"auto"` (the default), `"light"`, or `"dark"`.
Auto mode inherits the host's CSS `color-scheme` and typography. Use it when
the host publishes its active scheme through CSS. If the application stores an
account-level theme that can differ from the operating-system preference, pass
the current `"light"` or `"dark"` value and the corresponding product tokens.
Changing `themeMode` or `tokens` on a later render immediately restyles the
built-in launcher and open dialog; the provider and headless client do not need
to be remounted. Override individual tokens without replacing the UI:

```tsx
<EnhancementReporterButton
  appearance={{
    themeMode: "dark",
    tokens: {
      accent: "#7c3aed",
      accentText: "#ffffff",
      infoText: "#60a5fa",
      radius: "8px",
      fontFamily: "var(--app-font)",
    },
    style: {
      zIndex: 1000,
      "--handrail-enhancement-warning-text": "var(--app-warning)",
    },
  }}
/>
```

Available tokens are `accent`, `accentText`, `surface`, `surfaceMuted`, `text`,
`mutedText`, `border`, `overlay`, `dangerSurface`, `dangerText`,
`successSurface`, `successText`, `warningSurface`, `warningText`, `infoSurface`,
`infoText`, `radius`, and `fontFamily`. They map to scoped
`--handrail-enhancement-*` CSS custom properties. `appearance.className`
targets the dialog and `appearance.style` targets the overlay, so an
application can add narrowly scoped, type-safe CSS-variable overrides. Direct
variables in `appearance.style` take precedence over `appearance.tokens`.
The built-in launcher installs the configured tokens on itself, so its default
primary treatment matches the dialog. Launcher `className` and `style` props
remain separate and still replace that default treatment when supplied.

The dialog is viewport-bounded at 1560 × 960 px and scrolls internally on
smaller screens. It
has labeled dialog and tab semantics, traps keyboard focus while open, supports
arrow/Home/End tab navigation, closes with Escape or an overlay click, and
restores focus to the prior control. Loading, validation, failure, and success
states are exposed as text and live-region announcements; status meaning does
not depend on color alone.

The dialog supports file upload, direct image paste from the clipboard, and drag and drop onto the screenshot area. Each thumbnail has a visible View affordance and opens a larger preview with filename, position, previous/next controls, and Left/Right Arrow navigation. Accessible Earlier/Later controls reorder selected images, and the submitted attachment order matches the visible order. Accepted formats are PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP, with a maximum of 4 images, 5 MiB per image, and 15 MiB total. Both the browser and Handrail validate image signatures and limits.

### Host CSP for image previews

The packaged React UI renders selected, pasted, and dropped local images from
browser `blob:` URLs. If the host application sends a Content Security Policy,
allow those previews in `img-src`; a typical same-origin directive is
`img-src 'self' data: blob:`. Add `blob:` only to `img-src`, not `script-src` or
a broad `default-src`. Test with the production-equivalent policy and verify
that the thumbnail actually decodes and renders—a filename or attachment card
alone does not prove the preview loaded.

The packaged dialog shows its unchecked **Email me when this is fixed** control
only when policy discovery confirms that the current session
is a verified Known User with a valid configured Display/email value. It shows
only a masked recipient hint and never asks for or sends a manual address. The
browser submits the enhancement first and then sends report-scoped consent to
the same-origin `/requests/:requestId/subscription` route; Handrail verifies the
session again and derives the recipient from Known Users. A subscription
failure is returned as a separate warning. Handrail sends one email after
release evidence confirms the fix is available in the environment where the
request originated; internal Fixed and Deployed transitions do not each send
mail. The email includes an unsubscribe link. Set `notificationsEnabled: false` to hide the control. The
legacy `reporterEmail` option is ignored and deprecated for source
compatibility.

The dialog never asks the customer to authorize work or choose a deployment target. Submission authority is intake-only. After an assessment reaches Proposal Ready, Handrail automatically creates implementation work only when the assessed risk is within the current role's configured ceiling. Staff can separately authorize a proposal outside that ceiling; neither path grants the SDK deployment authority.

Every verified Known User may submit while the runtime enhancement switch is enabled. The dialog calls the same-origin discovery route before rendering navigation, and every verified user receives the **My requests** header action automatically. The history view lists only requests owned by the current authenticated principal. Submitted image thumbnails and their larger history previews are built with `client.attachmentUrl(requestId, attachmentId)`, so image bytes continue to pass through the same principal-scoped route; the UI does not trust or navigate directly to an attachment's returned `download_path`. Known User roles affect later Handrail authorization decisions; they never turn SDK submission into implementation authority.

**My requests** initially loads the 10 newest active requests and offers **Show
more** for older bounded pages. When discovery advertises them, the packaged UI
also exposes search, status, sort, and Active/Archived/All visibility filters,
plus individual **Archive** and **Restore** actions. It deliberately provides
no bulk clear action. Archive and restore update the visible status counts
immediately and then refresh the current server-backed page. Accepted
submissions are also inserted into an already loaded matching newest page, with
the badge and summary updated immediately. **My requests** then revalidates its
current query when it opens, refreshes it every 15 seconds while the view remains
open, and ignores slower superseded filter responses.
The tracker scrolls within the stable dialog and changes its desktop journey
table to compact cards before the layout can overflow. Every row presents the
customer-safe **Suggested → Assessed → Plan ready → Implemented → Released → Confirmed**
journey, with green completed milestones, blue active work, amber waits, red
blocks, and neutral pending stages. Proposal Ready requests outside the current
automatic implementation ceiling say **Awaiting team decision**; they are never
presented as approved or promised. Each row can expand into a delivery receipt
with the request description, canonical stage timing, assessed change risk,
automatic or staff-authorized implementation, manual handoff count, confirmed
environment, reference ID, submitted date and time, submitted app version, and
attachment names. The desktop list keeps implementation-only Work Request IDs
out of view. Each row also summarizes the strongest release evidence available
and includes the deployed application version when Handrail has recorded one.
Missing release tracking or environment targets display
**Deployment status unavailable** rather than **Not deployed**. Archiving only
changes that principal's history presentation; it never deletes, cancels, or
changes the first-class enhancement or any later linked implementation Work Request. Set `historyPageSize` on
`EnhancementReporterDialog` to use another page size from 1 through 50.

The SDK does not impose a history screen on app-owned integrations. `list` returns exact summary counts for a tab badge and status filters, plus the server-normalized query. Apps can style Active and Archived views independently and restore individual requests while preserving every canonical enhancement. The wire-level visibility value remains `dismissed` for compatibility.

## Custom/headless browser API

```ts
import { createEnhancementReporter } from "@handrail/enhancement-reporter";

const reporter = createEnhancementReporter({
  endpoint: "/api/handrail-enhancements",
  appVersion: "2026.08.13",
});

await reporter.submit({
  title: "Add a saved filter view",
  description: "Let me save the current filters and share the view with my team.",
  images: [{ data: file, filename: file.name, source: "upload" }],
  // Optional and report-scoped. Handrail derives the recipient from the
  // authenticated, verified Known User; never collect or send an address.
  notification: { notifyOnResolution: true },
});

const badgePage = await reporter.list({ limit: 1, visibility: "active" });
const myRequestsBadge = badgePage.summary?.total ?? badgePage.pagination.total;

const mine = await reporter.list({
  limit: 10,
  search: "calendar",
  statusGroup: "succeeded",
  sort: "newest",
  visibility: "active",
});
const current = await reporter.lookup(mine.requests[0].id);
const release = await reporter.releaseStatus(current.id);
await reporter.dismiss(current.id);
await reporter.restore(current.id);
await reporter.dismissSucceeded();
```

For a custom React presentation, mount the provider and consume the same client
without mounting either packaged UI component:

```tsx
import { useEnhancementReporter } from "@handrail/enhancement-reporter/react";

function SuggestionForm() {
  const reporter = useEnhancementReporter();
  // Build app-specific fields and consent UI, then call reporter.submit(...).
  return <YourSuggestionForm reporter={reporter} />;
}
```

`list({ limit, offset, search, statusGroup, sort, visibility })` returns bounded pagination metadata, exact counts for `needs_attention`, `in_progress`, `succeeded`, and `closed`, customer-facing journey counts, and the normalized query. Each request's `delivery_journey` is projected server-side from canonical assessment, policy authorization, Work Request step, release, and post-release confirmation evidence. Missing deployment evidence remains pending or unavailable; `Released` requires successful deployment evidence. Confirmation appears only after release and never delays or undoes the released outcome. `visibility` accepts `active`, `dismissed`, or `all`. `releaseStatus` reports the eventual full commit SHA/version and its deployment state after policy-authorized implementation produces and delivers the linked Work Request. `dismiss`, `restore`, and `dismissSucceeded` change only the current principal's history presentation while preserving the first-class enhancement and any later linked implementation Work Request.

## Security contract

- Browser transport is same-origin only and always sends `credentials: "same-origin"`.
- The application resolves a session token afresh for every request; no anonymous or static-user fallback exists.
- Handrail resolves the session through Known Users and scopes submit, list, lookup, attachment, dismissal, restoration, bulk history clearing, cancellation, and release status to that principal.
- Server code allowlists intake fields and drops browser-supplied implementation, Codex, commit, CI, and deployment authority.
- Handrail enhancement transport credentials remain server-only.

### Opt-in All users history

`list({ audience: "all", signal })` and
`lookup(id, { audience: "all", signal })` request shared history. The default is
Mine; `visibility: "all"` still means active plus personally archived requests.
Each shared read fetches fresh policy and requires authenticated Known Users
identity plus `enhancement_reporting.history.all_users === true`. The server
rechecks its saved Automation opt-in and current session for every read.

The packaged dialog adds **Mine / All users** only from verified discovery.
Pass a non-secret `sessionKey` to `EnhancementReporterProvider` or the standalone
`EnhancementReporterDialog`, changing it on sign-out, account or tenant switch.
Client changes reset the dialog; pending history is aborted and stale responses
are discarded. Headless integrations must abort/discard their retained data on
the same transitions. Never use the raw application session as `sessionKey`.

Shared content includes titles, descriptions, priority, status and dates within
the current Handrail project/environment/identity source. Attachments, private
context, reporter identity, assessment/work IDs and release journeys remain
private. Other users' records have `is_owner: false`; archive, restore, cancel,
notifications and implementation authority are unchanged. This is project-wide
sharing, not application subtenant authorization: leave OFF if those subtenants
share one Known Users source and must not see each other's report text.
